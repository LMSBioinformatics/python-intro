# This exercise should be done in the interpreter

# Assign numerical values to 2 variables, calculate the mean of these two variables
# and store the result in another variable. Print out the result to the screen

v1 = 5.0
v2 = 10.0
mean = (v1 + v2) / 2
print mean 


# The distance from White City Station to the CSC is 0.6 miles. 
# Assuming a walking speed of 3 miles per hour, how long does it approximately take to walk to the station from here?

distance = 0.6
speed = 3

time = distance / speed
print time

# From East Acton the distance to the CSC is 0.8 km. Which station is closest (there are ~1.6 kilometers in a mile) 

EastActonKm = 0.8
EastActonMiles = 0.8 / 1.6

print EastActonMiles
